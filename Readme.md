# What this guide is about
In this guide i will be describing how to play/view the PacMan game that has been created on Unity.



# How to use my project in Unity
This project was produced in Unity using the programming language C#. This guide will be describing how to load the game onto Unity and see how the game was created.

Unity Hub must be installed in order to load the game. 

There will be a UnityPlayer.dll file that will be attached to the repository which is the final build of the game, however this guide will be describing how to load the game onto Unity Hub.

Step 1:
Firstly Load Unity Hub.

Step 2:
Create a 2D Project with any name that you wish.

Step 3:
Go to the file directory that you have created the project in.

These files should be displayed.

Step 4:
Download and extract the Assets folder in the technical documentation repository and place into a temporary folder

Step 5:
Download and extract the ProjectSettings folder in the technical documentation repository and place into a temporary folder

Step 6:
You should have two files in your  temporary folder.

![Assets+ProjectSettings](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/ce301_21-22/CE301_hussain_fahad_a/-/blob/master/guide/Project+assets.png)

Step 7:
Replace the Assets folder and Project setting folder in the project you created via the files you have placed in the temporary folder.

These files contains the necessary scripts and components needed for the game to work.
Once you have replaced the files, Load the project onto unity.

There will be two scenes in the file Structure, one is The Menu scene, the other is the MainGame scene which is located in the scenes folder, this scene is where the the game was essentially created.

![BaseGameScene](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/ce301_21-22/CE301_hussain_fahad_a/-/blob/master/guide/BaseGame_Scene.png)

You will now be able see how the game was created using Unity and C#
